# ITS122P - Final Project Document
> **Current Phase:** Phase 1 - Draft Proposal

## Project Title: Book Exchange Web Application

The **Book Exchange Web Application** is a web-based system that allows users to list books they no longer need, browse books offered by others, send and manage exchange requests, and track the status of exchange transactions from request to completion.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Students, teachers, and anyone else who reads books often have many books they have already read and no longer need, but still want to get more books without buying brand-new copies. At present, most book exchanges occur informally through social media posts, group chats, bulletin boards, or word of mouth.

This informal approach leads to several recurring issues:

- There is no central location to check the availability of books for exchange.
- It is time-consuming and unreliable to find a person interested in a specific book or willing to trade a specific book.
- Exchange requests are easy to lose track of when handled through verbal agreements or chat messages.
- There is no consistent way of confirming when a transaction has been completed.
- There is no easy way for owners to show the condition of the books.

The **Book Exchange Web Application** aims to solve these problems by providing a single, organized platform where users can list, search, and filter books, as well as submit and track exchange requests. This centralization helps reduce confusion, save time, and create a more reliable and transparent book exchange process.

## 4. User Roles

### Administration

The Administration role mainly handles the application's overall management and ensures that the system is operating correctly.

Administrators can:

- Provide Staff status to users who meet the required criteria.
- Remove Staff or Customer permissions when necessary.
- Remove users from the platform.
- Manage books listed in the application.
- Manage book categories.
- Review and manage reports.
- Access and manage system records.
- Monitor and manage exchange and purchase transactions.

### Staff

Staff users have less access than Administrators but are still able to operate and maintain selected system functions.

Staff users can:

- Act as moderators for Customer users.
- Manage Customer account statuses and permissions.
- Review forms submitted by Customers.
- Approve or reject submitted requests or forms.
- Manage Customer transaction statuses.
- Process or review refund requests.
- Report system problems or errors to Administration.

### Customer

Customer users are the standard users of the application.

Customers can:

- List books.
- Browse books listed by other users.
- Purchase listed books.
- Initiate book trading or exchange transactions.
- Manage their transactions.
- Cancel eligible transactions.
- Request refunds.
- File reports or forms.

## 5. System Architecture

The system will use a **Client-Server Architecture**.

### Basic Flow

**User → Web Browser → Web Server → Database**

The user accesses the system through a web browser. The web server processes the user's requests and communicates with the database to store, retrieve, and update information.

### Architecture Components

- **Client / Web Browser**
  - Displays the web application's interface.
  - Accepts input from the user.
  - Sends requests to the web server.

- **Web Server**
  - Processes requests sent by users.
  - Handles application logic.
  - Validates and processes data.
  - Communicates with the database.

- **Database**
  - Stores user accounts.
  - Stores books and book listings.
  - Stores transactions.
  - Stores reports and refund requests.
  - Stores system records.

## 6. Initial ERD

![ERD Diagram](assets/ERD.png)

The current ERD contains the following main tables:

- `USERS`
- `USER_BOOKS`
- `BOOK_CATALOG`
- `BOOK_CATEGORIES`
- `TRANSACTIONS`
- `REPORTS`
- `REFUND_REQUESTS`
- `SYSTEM_RECORDS`

### Role, Business Rules, and Table Mapping

| Role | Business Rules | Table & Field Mapping |
|---|---|---|
| Admin | Manage Users | `USERS (role, status)` |
| Admin | Manage Reports | `REPORTS (reviewed_by_id, status where report_category = 'User_Violation', etc.)` |
| Admin | Manage Books & Categories | `BOOK_CATALOG, BOOK_CATEGORIES` |
| Admin | Manage Records | `SYSTEM_RECORDS` |
| Staff | Manage Customer Statuses & Permissions | `USERS (status, permissions, managed_by_staff_id)` |
| Staff | Approve or Reject Customer Forms | `REPORTS (status, reviewed_by_id where report_category = 'Verification_Form' or 'Seller_Application')` |
| Staff | Manage Customer User Statuses | `USERS (status, managed_by_staff_id)` |
| Staff | Manage Customer Transactions | `TRANSACTIONS (status, managed_by_staff_id)` |
| Customer | List Books for Purchase | `USER_BOOKS (listing_type = 'For_Sale')` |
| Customer | Buy Listed Books | `TRANSACTIONS (transaction_type = 'Purchase')` |
| Customer | Trade / Exchange Books | `TRANSACTIONS (transaction_type = 'Trade')` |
| Customer | Request a Refund | `REFUND_REQUESTS` |
| Customer | File a Report / Form | `REPORTS (submitted_by_id, report_category, form_data)` |

  - Used for asynchronous communication between the application and the server.
  - Allows parts of a page to update without requiring the whole page to reload.

- **XML**
  - Used for structured data exchange between systems when needed.

- **HTTP**
